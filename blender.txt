I'm learning blender! Here are some of the things that I've learned:

• Space tells you all the hotkeys (not by default)
• Middle click to look around
• Control + middle click or scroll to zoom in and out
• G to move or G + an axis to move by that axis (same for r (rotate) and s (scale)) (I guess that one was a bit of a bonus) (Whewee, I am using a lot of parentheses)
• Select the thing that you want to delete and then X to delete
